It needs a capable GPU to run models (**at least 4GB VRAM**).\n","\n","You can explore the variety of models available through Ollama here:\n","\n","![pic10.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZvD7_yeSCETl98vXI5zo_TikF6Wpu0-r)\n","\n","### Why Use Code (API) for Data Mining?\n","\n","For data analysis, accessing LLMs programmatically is superior to using web chatbots because it allows for:\n","*   **Automation:** Easily process entire datasets with loops.\n","*   **Structured Output:** Receive data in usable formats like **JSON**, ready for analysis in tools like pandas.\n","*   **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results by setting fixed parameters.\n","*   **Privacy:** Maintain data security, especially when running models locally.\n","\n","For the main exercises in this lab, we will use **the Gemini API**. This approach offers several advantages over running local open-source models, such as access to state-of-the-art model performance without needing specialized hardware. While the API has usage limits (rate limits and token quotas), it provides a generous **free tier** that is more than sufficient for our exercises.\n","\n","![pic13.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1UGHgSyH2-m2ZdjJXJ39_8RCgZov2z94d)\n","\n","![pic14.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1D0Q5KpS5bNIH8er0kb8SWt1nZJhfufWa)\n","\n","### The Gemini API\n","\n","We will primarily use the **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) model. As shown in the rate limit table, this model is optimized for high-frequency tasks and offers a high request-per-day limit of 1,000, making it ideal for completing the lab exercises without interruption.\n","\n","Students are encouraged to explore other models available through the API but should remain mindful of their respective usage limits. For instance:\n","*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is a more powerful model but has a lower daily request limit of 100.\n","*   The **Gemma 3** model available via the API offers an impressive 14,400 requests per day, providing another excellent alternative for experimentation.\n","\n","Please be aware of your usage limits as you work through the exercises to ensure you do not get rate-limited.\n","\n","[Gemini Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)\n","\n","[Gemini Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)\n","\n","[Description of Gemini Models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VuFHxTWGzAJI"},"source":["---\n","\n","### Interacting with the Gemini API\n","\n","The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n","\n","Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n","\n","*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n","\n","*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n","    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n","    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n","    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n","\n","*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n","    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n","    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n","    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n","    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n","\n","In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n","\n","If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":41,"metadata":{"id":"X8CKxw2IzAJI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761041626281,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1608,"user":{"displayName":"David-Oliver Matzka","userId":"17699470839693386717"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"bad3203b-b67c-4f83-829c-88b948a23b53"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:google_genai._api_client:Both GOOGLE_API_KEY and GEMINI_API_KEY are set.

Biological/Evolutionary Perspective:**\n","\n","*   **Meaning:** To survive, reproduce, and pass on genes. From this viewpoint, life's \"purpose\" is inherent in its biological drive. Our existence is a continuation of a long evolutionary process.\n","*   **Focus:** Survival, adaptation, procreation.\n","\n","**2. Religious/Spiritual Perspectives:**\n","\n","*   **Meaning:** Often tied to a divine plan or higher power. This can involve serving God, achieving spiritual enlightenment, fulfilling a divine purpose, or preparing for an afterlife. Different religions offer diverse narratives and prescriptions for living a meaningful life.\n","*   **Examples:**\n","    *   **Christianity:** To love God and neighbor, to follow Jesus' teachings, and to achieve salvation.\n","    *   **Buddhism:** To end suffering by achieving enlightenment (Nirvana) through the Eightfold Path.\n","    *   **Islam:** To submit to the will of Allah and live according to the Quran and Sunnah.\n","    *   **Hinduism:** To achieve Moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth) through dharma (duty), karma (action), and devotion.\n","*   **Focus:** Faith, devotion, spiritual growth, moral conduct, afterlife.\n","\n","**3. Philosophical Perspectives:**\n","\n","*   **Nihilism:** Life has no inherent meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. This can be a bleak outlook, but some find freedom in the absence of preordained meaning.\n","*   **Existentialism:** Meaning is not given, but *created* by individuals through their choices and actions. We are free and responsible for defining our own essence and purpose in a meaningless universe.\n","    *   **Key figures:** Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir.\n","    *   **Focus:** Freedom, responsibility, authenticity, creating one's own values.\n","*   **Absurdism:** Acknowledges the human desire for meaning and the universe's apparent lack of it. The meaning lies in embracing this absurdity and rebelling against it by living fully and passionately.\n","    *   **Key figure:** Albert Camus.\n","    *   **Focus:** Rebellion, passion, freedom in the face of the absurd.\n","*   **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the primary goal of life.\n","    *   **Focus:** Pleasure, happiness, enjoyment.\n","*   **Stoicism:** To live in accordance with nature and reason, accepting what cannot be controlled and focusing on virtue and inner peace.\n","    *   **Focus:** Virtue, reason, acceptance, resilience.\n","*   **Humanism:** Emphasizes human reason, ethics, and justice, often finding meaning in contributing to the well-being of humanity and the world.\n","    *   **Focus:** Human potential, reason, ethics, social progress.\n","\n","**4. Personal and Subjective Perspectives:**\n","\n","*   **Meaning is what you make it:** For many, the meaning of life is not a grand cosmic truth but a collection of personal values, experiences, and goals. This can include:\n","    *   **Relationships:** Love, family, friendship, connection.\n","    *   **Contribution:** Making a difference, helping others, leaving a legacy.\n","    *   **Growth and Learning:** Acquiring knowledge, developing skills, self-improvement.\n","    *   **Creativity and Expression:** Art, music, writing, innovation.\n","    *   **Experiences:** Travel, adventure, appreciating beauty, savoring moments.\n","    *   **Purposeful Work:** Finding fulfillment in one's career or vocation.\n","    *   **Happiness and Well-being:** Living a life that brings joy and contentment.\n","\n","**In summary, the \"meaning of life\" is not a fixed destination but a journey of exploration and creation.**\n","\n","*   **It's not about finding a pre-written answer, but about asking the question and actively engaging with it.**\n","*   **Your meaning can evolve over time.** What gives your life meaning today might be different in ten years.\n","*   **It's often found in the small, everyday moments as much as in grand pursuits.**\n","\n","Ultimately, the most profound meaning of life is likely the one you discover and create for yourself. It's about living authentically, pursuing what you value, and finding connection and purpose in your own unique way.\n","{'model': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 1001}\n","Of course. This is perhaps the most profound question a person can ask, and it has been contemplated by philosophers, theologians, scientists, and artists for millennia.\n","\n","There is no single, universally accepted answer. Instead, the \"meaning of life\" can be understood through several different lenses. The power of the question isn't in finding one right answer, but in the journey of exploring what is meaningful to you.\n","\n","Here is an explanation broken down into the most common perspectives.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 1. The Religious & Spiritual Perspective: Meaning is Given\n","\n","In most spiritual traditions, the meaning of life is external to us. It is given by a higher power or a cosmic order, and our purpose is to discover and align ourselves with it.\n","\n","*   **Abrahamic Religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam):** Life's purpose is generally to know, love, and serve God. Meaning is found in fulfilling God's commandments, living a virtuous life, and preparing for an afterlife. The ultimate meaning transcends our earthly existence.\n","*   **Eastern Religions (Buddhism, Hinduism):** The goal is often to achieve enlightenment and break free from the cycle of suffering and rebirth (samsara).\n","    *   In **Hinduism**, meaning is found in fulfilling one's *dharma* (duty or righteous path) to achieve *moksha* (liberation).\n","    *   In **Buddhism**, meaning is found in following the Eightfold Path to reach *Nirvana*, a state of liberation from suffering and desire.\n","\n","**In short: This perspective suggests meaning is something to be *discovered* through faith and scripture.**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. The Philosophical Perspective: Meaning is Questioned and Created\n","\n","Philosophy tackles the question without necessarily relying on a divine being. This leads to a wide range of answers.\n","\n","*   **Nihilism:** This is the belief that life has **no intrinsic meaning, purpose, or value**. A nihilist would argue that the universe is indifferent and any meaning we perceive is a human invention.\n","*   **Existentialism:** This is a powerful response to nihilism. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus agree that there is no pre-ordained meaning to the universe (it is \"absurd\"). However, they argue that this ultimate freedom is what allows us to **create our own meaning**. We are defined by our choices, our actions, and the values we commit to. Your life's meaning is what you decide it will be.\n","*   **Humanism:** This perspective finds meaning in human flourishing. The purpose of life is to live ethically, use reason, and work towards the greater good of humanity and the world, without need for a supernatural justification. Meaning is found in compassion, knowledge, and improving the human condition.\n","*   **Stoicism:** For Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, meaning comes from living a life of virtue and reason, in accordance with nature. It's about focusing on what you can control (your thoughts and actions) and accepting what you cannot with grace and resilience.\n","\n","**In short: This perspective suggests meaning is something to be *built* through reason, choice, and action.**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. The Scientific & Biological Perspective: Meaning is Explained\n","\n","Science doesn't ask \"why\" in a purposeful sense, but \"how.\" It describes the mechanisms of life, not a grand purpose for it.\n","\n","*   **Evolutionary Biology:** From a purely biological standpoint, the \"purpose\" of any organism is to survive and reproduce, passing its genes to the next generation. Our complex emotions, our drive for connection, and even our search for meaning can be seen as evolutionary adaptations that helped our ancestors cooperate and survive.\n","*   **Cosmology:** From this view, we are a product of the universe's evolution. As Carl Sagan famously said, \"We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.\" The meaning isn't a pre-written script for us, but can be found in the awe-inspiring fact of our existence—that a collection of stardust can become conscious and contemplate the universe it came from.\n","\n","**In short: This perspective suggests meaning isn't a purpose *for* us, but can be found in the wonder *of* our existence and the processes that created us.**\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. The Personal & Psychological Perspective: Meaning is Felt\n","\n","This view brings the question down to the individual level. Regardless of grand cosmic or philosophical theories, meaning is what feels significant and fulfilling to *you*.\n","\n","Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor, wrote in his book *Man's Search for Meaning* that the primary drive in life is not pleasure, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful. He identified three primary sources:\n","\n","1.  **Creation:** Creating a work or doing a deed. This is about what you give to the world (your career, your art, your contribution).\n","2.  **Experience:** Experiencing something or encountering someone. This is about what you take from the world (love, relationships, beauty, nature).\n","3.  **Attitude:** The attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. Even in the worst circumstances, we can find meaning by choosing how we respond.\n","\n","Common sources of personal meaning include:\n","*   **Relationships:** Love, family, friendship, and community.\n","*   **Contribution:** Making a positive impact on others or the world.\n","*   **Growth:** Overcoming challenges and becoming a better version of yourself.\n","*   **Creativity:** Expressing yourself through art, music, or innovation.\n","*   **Legacy:** Leaving something behind for future generations.\n","\n","### Conclusion: A Possible Synthesis\n","\n","Perhaps the most useful way to think about the meaning of life is that it's not something you *find* like a hidden treasure, but something you **build**.\n","\n","You build it from the materials you are given: your biology, your circumstances, your relationships. You build it with the tools you choose: your values, your actions, your attitude.\n","\n","The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" might be the wrong one. A better question might be:\n","\n","**\"What meaning will I create for my life?\"**\n","{'model': 'gemini-2.5-pro', 'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 1300}\n"]}],"source":["# Answer here\n","input_prompt = [\"Explain the meaning of life.\"]\n","text_response_lite, logs_lite = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = input_prompt, with_tokens_info = True)\n","text_response_pro, logs_pro = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = input_prompt, model_name=\"gemini-2.5-pro\", with_tokens_info = True)\n","print(text_response_lite)\n","print(logs_lite)\n","print(text_response_pro)\n","print(logs_pro)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Flash (flash-lite) gave a good, clear summary of the \"meaning of life\" stuff, while Pro gave a more detailed version with extra examples and slightly better formatting.

This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to.

For \n","example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n","diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n","this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n","discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n","themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n","This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n","during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n","uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n","travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n","black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n","planets. \n","Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n","opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n","‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n","feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n","that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n","increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n","seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n","At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n","tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n","which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know.

‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n"," 'document_id': 'doc_591a9ed4'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":56}],"source":["import json\n","# We can also observe the structure of the raw extracted data\n","with open(\"./DM2025-Lab2-Exercise/results/info_extractions/review_extraction_example.jsonl\", \"r\") as f:\n","    content_extracted_raw = json.load(f)\n","content_extracted_raw"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":57,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":558},"id":"02CfKmLOzAJV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761041672963,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"David-Oliver Matzka","userId":"17699470839693386717"}},"outputId":"20a0a5fa-b98b-4e23-f071-c1f9661ccb60"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<style>\n",".lx-highlight { position: relative;

For \n","example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n","diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n","this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n","discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n","themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n","<span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’</span> as Nolan sets his characters \n","during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n","uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n","travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n","black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n","planets. \n","Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n","opportunities to create <span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">crazy scenarios</span>. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n","‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n","feet deep water. <span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">Not threatening at all right?</span> Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n","that <span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"5\" style=\"background-color:#C8E6C9;\">a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them</span>, and they have <span class=\"lx-highlight\" data-idx=\"6\" style=\"background-color:#D2E3FC;\">minutes to ﬂy away</span>. Nolan further \n","increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n","seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n","At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n","tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n","which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth.

This whole section including the exercise is now considered a bonus section, not counted for the main grade.`\n","\n","RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n","\n","In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n","\n","In this example we use the library langchain, for documentation on more functions of the library you can check the following link: [LangChain Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":73,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"plDqfOGMzAJa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761041835952,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"David-Oliver Matzka","userId":"17699470839693386717"}},"outputId":"9ddcb942-ba92-415d-97ad-1c929f2791f9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:langchain_community.utils.user_agent:USER_AGENT environment variable not set, consider setting it to identify your requests.\n"]}],"source":["from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings\n","\n","# Function to load, split, and retrieve documents\n","def load_and_retrieve_docs(url):\n","    loader = WebBaseLoader(\n","        web_paths=(url,),\n","        bs_kwargs=dict()\n","    )\n","    docs = loader.load() #We will load the URL that will serve as our data source\n","    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150) #We will divide the URL in chunks of text for easier comparison in the vector space\n","    splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n","    #print(splits) #You can print this to see how the chunks in the url where split\n","    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model=\"models/gemini-embedding-001\")\n","    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embeddings) #Our vector space for comparison\n","    return vectorstore.as_retriever()\n","\n","\n","def format_docs(docs):\n","    return \"\\n\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) #Format the retrieved docs in an orderly manner for prompting\n","\n","# Define the Gemini LLM function\n","def gemini_llm(question, context):\n","    system_prompt = \"You are a RAG Agent that needs to provide a well structured answer based on the provided question and context.\"\n","    formatted_prompt = f\"Question: {question}\\n\\nContext: {context}\"\n","    response, logs = prompt_gemini(input_prompt = formatted_prompt, system_instruction = system_prompt, with_tokens_info = True)\n","    print(f\"logs: \\n{logs}\")\n","    #

**2.6 Few-Shot Prompting Classification:**\n","\n","Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n","\n","In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n","\n","*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n","*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n","*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n","\n","To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n","\n","1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n","2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n","\n","We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n","\n","**Prompt Structure:**\n","`System Instruction -> Task Description -> Examples (if not zero-shot) -> Text to Classify`\n","\n","\n","<span style=\"color:green\">For the exercises in this section there is no need to re-run the cells, you can use the data that has been saved previously to the corresponding directory.</span>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":76,"metadata":{"id":"n-BgECWozAJc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761041839802,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"David-Oliver Matzka","userId":"17699470839693386717"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Funciton for visualizing confusion_matrix\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy as np\n","import itertools\n","\n","def plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes, title='Confusion matrix',\n","                          cmap=sns.cubehelix_palette(as_cmap=True)):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This function is modified from:\n","    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html\n","    \"\"\"\n","    classes.sort()\n","    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n","\n","    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5,5))\n","    im = ax.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)\n","    ax.figure.colorbar(im, ax=ax)\n","    ax.set(xticks=np.arange(cm.shape[1]),\n","           yticks=np.arange(cm.shape[0]),\n","           xticklabels = classes,\n","           yticklabels = classes,\n","           title = title,\n","           xlabel = 'Predicted label',\n","           ylabel = 'True label')\n","\n","    fmt = 'd'\n","    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n","    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n","        plt.text(j, i, format(cm[i, j], fmt), horizontalalignment=\"center\", color=\"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n","    ylim_top = len(classes) - 0.5\n","    plt.ylim([ylim_top, -.5])\n","    plt.tight_layout()\n","    plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":90,"metadata":{"id":"NwfGvUv2zAJc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761045168109,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":55,"user":{"displayName":"David-Oliver Matzka","userId":"17699470839693386717"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report\n","import enum\n","import os\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import json\n","import time\n","# Define the emotion labels\n","emotions = ['anger', 'fear', 'joy', 'sadness']\n","# Define the model to use for few-shot prompting\n","\n","# Schema for the output, the type enum can be used to make a pool of options if what we want is to classify our text selecting only one of them\n","class Emotions(enum.StrEnum):\n","    ANGER = 'anger'\n","    FEAR = 'fear'\n","    JOY = 'joy'\n","    SADNESS = 'sadness'\n","\n","\n","# Function to handle the rate limits of gemini models\n","def handle_rate_limit(request_count, first_request_time, max_calls_per_min):\n","    current_time = time.time()\n","\n","    # Initialize timer on the first request of a new window\n","    if request_count == 0:\n","        first_request_time = current_time\n","\n","    request_count += 1\n","\n","    # If the rate limit is reached\n","    if request_count > max_calls_per_min:\n","        elapsed_time = current_time - first_request_time\n","        if elapsed_time < 60:\n","            wait_time = 60 - elapsed_time\n","            print(f\"Rate limit of {max_calls_per_min} requests per minute reached.

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
